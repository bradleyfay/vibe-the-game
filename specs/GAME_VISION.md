# Game Vision

The big dream for our game! This document captures what we want to build, even if it's ambitious. We'll work toward it step by step.

## Instructions

Fill this out together with your son BEFORE starting to code. Let him describe his ideas. Dream big here! The prototypes will break this down into achievable pieces.

---

## Ultimate Vision

**The game we dream of building** (even if it takes months or years):

> [Fill in: What kind of game do you want to make? Describe it in a few sentences.]
>
> Example: "A top-down adventure game where you explore a huge world, fight monsters, collect treasure, and build a base. Eventually it could be 3D like Fortnite with friends playing together!"

## Core Experience

**How should the game FEEL to play?**

What emotions or experiences do you want players to have?

- [ ] **Exciting** (fast action, surprises)
- [ ] **Relaxing** (peaceful, no pressure)

## Design Pillars

**The 3 most important things about this game** (what we won't compromise on):

1. **[e.g., "Fun to explore"]**: The world should be interesting to wander
2. **[e.g., "Easy to understand"]**: Anyone can pick it up and play
3. **[e.g., "Fair challenges"]**: Difficult but never frustrating

These help us make decisions: "Does this feature support our pillars?"

---

## Story (Optional)

**Is there a story? (Optional - games don't need stories!)**

### Beginning
> [e.g., "You wake up in a village. Everyone is scared. Something is wrong with the forest."]

### Middle
> [e.g., "You explore the forest, fighting monsters and finding clues about what happened."]

### End
> [e.g., "You discover the dark wizard and defeat them, saving the village."]

---

## Scope & Milestones

**How do we get from "nothing" to "the dream"?**

### Next Achievable Milestone (3 months)

What can we realistically build in the next 3 months?

> [e.g., "A working top-down game where you can move around a world with several screens, collect items, and fight simple enemies. No story yet, just core gameplay working."]

### Milestone After That (6 months)

> [e.g., "Add NPCs, quests, and a save system. Multiple areas with different themes."]

### Long-Term Vision (12+ months)

> [e.g., "Polish everything, add story, make assets look professional, maybe add multiplayer."]

## 2D → 3D Path (Future)

**Your son mentioned wanting Fortnite-like 3D eventually. Here's the path:**

### Why Start with 2D?
- 2D is simpler to learn (no camera angles, depth, 3D math)
- Faster to build (quicker feedback keeps learning fun)
- Core concepts are the same (movement, collision, mechanics)
- 2D skills transfer to 3D (just add one more dimension!)

### When to Try 3D?
**After you've completed**:
- All 6 prototypes (comfortable with 2D game development)
- At least one complete 2D game (understand full game loop)
- 6-12 months of 2D experience (strong foundation)

### 3D Progression Path
1. **Start with 3D backgrounds** (2D gameplay, 3D visuals - like old Pokemon)
2. **Hybrid approach** (top-down but in 3D world)
3. **Full 3D** (character can look around, aim in 3D)
4. **Multiplayer 3D** (like Fortnite)

**The dream is possible!** But we build skills first.

## Open Questions

**Things we haven't decided yet:**

- [ ] [e.g., "Should there be a health system or one-hit deaths?"]
- [ ] [e.g., "Pixel art style or drawn art?"]
- [ ] [e.g., "Sound effects or music? Both?"]
- [ ] [e.g., "How many different enemy types?"]

It's okay to not know everything! We'll figure it out as we build.

| Date | What Changed | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Initial vision created] | [First draft] |

## Notes

- **This is a living document**: Update it as ideas change!
- **Dream big here**: Don't worry about "how" yet
- **Have fun**: Your son's wild ideas are great! Write them all down
- **Reference often**: Check this before starting each new prototype

**Remember**: The vision doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to be exciting and clear enough to guide our next prototype!
