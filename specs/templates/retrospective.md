## What Worked Well

**Technical successes**:
- [e.g., "Hot reload made iteration super fast"]
- [e.g., "Phaser physics did collision automatically - easier than expected"]

**Learning successes**:
- [e.g., "Son understood game loop concept after seeing console.log output"]
- [e.g., "Drawing coordinates on paper before coding helped a lot"]

**Process successes**:
- [e.g., "Writing spec first kept us focused"]
- [e.g., "Taking breaks every 30 minutes kept energy up"]

**Fun moments**:
- [e.g., "Set speed to 1000 by accident - character zoomed off screen, we laughed"]
- [e.g., "Son named the character 'Flash' because it moved so fast"]

---

## What Was Challenging

**Technical challenges**:

### [Challenge 1: e.g., "Understanding velocity vs. position"]

**What was hard**: [Explain the difficulty]

**How we overcame it**: [What we did to solve it]

**Time spent**: [e.g., 15 minutes]

### [Challenge 2]

**What was hard**: [Explain]

**Time spent**: [e.g., 10 minutes]

---

## What Didn't Work

Be honest about failures - they're learning opportunities!

- [e.g., "First tried to do collision manually - too complicated, switched to Phaser physics"]
- [e.g., "Tried to explain vectors with math - too abstract, drew pictures instead"]
- [e.g., "Session went 70 minutes - too long, son got tired"]

---

## Learning Outcomes

### What Son Learned

**Technical concepts** (rate understanding 1-5):

| Concept | Before | After | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| [e.g., Coordinates] | [1] | [4] | [Drew grid on paper, clicked] |
| [e.g., Variables] | [2] | [5] | [Changed speed, saw instant result] |
| [e.g., Game loop] | [1] | [3] | [Still a bit abstract] |

**Game design concepts**:
- [e.g., "Learned that even simple movement can be fun with fast feedback"]
- [e.g., "Understood that player control is most important thing"]

**Soft skills**:
- [e.g., "Practiced breaking problem into steps"]
- [e.g., "Learned that bugs are puzzles, not failures"]

**Confidence level** (1-5): [e.g., "Went from 2 to 4 - feels capable now"]

### What Parent Learned

**Technical**:
- [e.g., "JavaScript syntax not as different from Python as expected"]
- [e.g., "Phaser's physics system is very approachable"]

**Teaching**:
- [e.g., "Need shorter explanations - show code, then explain"]
- [e.g., "Let him drive keyboard more - learns better by doing"]

**Process**:
- [e.g., "Spec-driven approach really kept us on track"]

---

## Code Quality

### What We're Proud Of

- [e.g., "Comments explain WHY, not just WHAT"]
- [e.g., "Named constants clearly (MOVEMENT_SPEED, not just 'speed')"]

### What Could Be Better

- [e.g., "Movement code is getting long - should extract to function"]
- [e.g., "Some magic numbers still hardcoded"]

### Technical Debt

Things we skipped for speed but should fix eventually:

- [ ] [e.g., "Extract movement to separate class"]
- [ ] [e.g., "Add input handling abstraction"]
- [ ] [e.g., "Normalize diagonal movement speed"]

## Son's Feedback

Direct quotes or paraphrased feedback from your son:

**What he liked most**:
> [e.g., "I liked changing the speed and making the character go super fast!"]

**What he found hardest**:
> [e.g., "I didn't understand why X and Y are different at first"]

**What he wants to add next**:
> [e.g., "Can we make walls? And different colors? And enemies that chase you?"]

**Fun rating** (1-10): [e.g., 9/10]

**Would he do another session?**: [Yes / No / Maybe]

## Connection to Game Vision

### How This Moves Us Forward

**Vision element**: [e.g., "Top-down adventure game"]

**What this prototype provided**: [e.g., "Foundation of all movement - player can now navigate space"]

**Gap remaining**: [e.g., "Need world larger than screen, obstacles, enemies, collectibles"]

### Insights for Future Prototypes

- [e.g., "Movement speed of 200 feels good - use this for future prototypes"]
- [e.g., "Son likes experimenting with parameters - include tunable constants"]

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] Update `specs/MECHANICS_LIBRARY.md` with movement mechanic details
- [ ] Update `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md` with session notes
- [ ] Commit this prototype: `git commit -m "feat(proto[XX]): [description]"`
- [ ] Show grandparents / friends the working game!

### Next Prototype Planning

**What to build next**: [e.g., "Prototype 02 - Add walls and collision"]

**Why this order**: [e.g., "Collision is natural next step - makes world feel solid"]

**Estimated time**: [e.g., "2 sessions, ~90 minutes"]

**New concepts to introduce**:
- [e.g., "Physics bodies"]
- [e.g., "Collision detection"]

### Code to Carry Forward

What should we copy/reuse in the next prototype?

- [e.g., "Movement code works well - copy as-is"]
- [e.g., "Project setup (HTML structure) - reuse"]

What should we change or improve?

- [e.g., "Extract movement to separate function - getting messy"]
- [e.g., "Use sprites instead of rectangles - more visually interesting"]
