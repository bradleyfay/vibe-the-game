# Prototype 01: Hello World - The Adventurer - Retrospective

Fill this out AFTER completing this prototype!

## Quick Info

**Completed**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Sessions**: [e.g., 1 session]
**Total Time**: [e.g., ~60 minutes]
**Status**: [ ] Complete / [ ] Partial / [ ] Abandoned

## What We Built

A simple game where you can move a character (red square) around the screen using arrow keys or WASD.

### Demo

[Add screenshot here by dragging an image file]

### Success Criteria Achievement

- [ ] Game window appears
- [ ] Character visible in center
- [ ] Arrow keys work
- [ ] WASD keys work
- [ ] Character stays in bounds
- [ ] Movement feels smooth
- [ ] Can change speed by editing code
- [ ] Hot reload works instantly

---

## What Worked Well

**Technical successes**:
- [e.g., "Setting up Phaser was easier than expected"]
- [e.g., "Velocity-based movement just worked"]

**Learning successes**:
- [e.g., "Son understood coordinates after drawing on paper"]
- [e.g., "Experimenting with MOVEMENT_SPEED was fun"]

**Process successes**:
- [e.g., "Writing spec first kept us focused"]
- [e.g., "45-minute session was perfect length"]

**Fun moments**:
- [e.g., "Set speed to 1000 - character zoomed off screen!"]
- [e.g., "Son named it 'Flash the Red Square'"]

## What Was Challenging

### Challenge 1: [e.g., "Understanding velocity vs. position"]

**What was hard**: [Explain the difficulty]

**How we overcame it**: [What you did to solve it]

**Time spent**: [e.g., 10 minutes]

## Learning Outcomes

### What Son Learned

**Technical concepts** (rate understanding 1-5):

| Concept | Before | After | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| Coordinates (X,Y) | 1 | [ ] | [ ] |
| Game loop | 1 | [ ] | [ ] |
| Variables | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| IF statements | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**Game design concepts**:
- [e.g., "Player control is most important"]

**Confidence level** (1-5): [Before: 1, After: __]

### What Parent Learned

**Technical**:
- [e.g., "Phaser basics"]
- [e.g., "JavaScript vs Python differences"]

**Teaching**:
- [e.g., "Show code, then explain - not the reverse"]

## Son's Feedback

**What he liked most**:
> [Quote or paraphrase]

**What he found hardest**:
> [Quote or paraphrase]

**What he wants to add next**:
> [Quote or paraphrase]

**Fun rating** (1-10): [__/10]

**Would he do another session?**: [ ] Yes / [ ] No / [ ] Maybe

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] Update `specs/MECHANICS_LIBRARY.md` with 8-directional movement
- [ ] Update `specs/MECHANICS_LIBRARY.md` with boundary checking
- [ ] Update `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md` with session notes
- [ ] Commit: `git commit -m "feat(proto01): implement character movement"`
- [ ] Show grandparents/friends!

### Next Prototype

**What to build**: Prototype 02 - Obstacles and Collision

**Why this order**: Collision detection is natural next step - makes world feel solid

**Estimated time**: 2 sessions

## Celebration Moments

- [ ] **First working game**
- [ ] **Son changed code independently**
- [ ] **Showed someone**
- [ ] **Understood game loop concept**
