    title: Prototype-Centric Learning
    details: Each prototype is a self-contained experiment. Failed experiments are learning moments, not failures. See clear progression from basic movement to complete games.

  - icon: 📝
    title: Spec-Driven Development
    details: Plan before coding with feature specs. Reflect after with retrospectives. Document mechanics in a living library. Real software engineering practices, simplified.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: Instant Feedback
    details: Hot reload in <1 second. Change code, save, see results immediately. Fast feedback keeps an 8-year-old engaged and learning.

  - icon: 🎯
    title: Clear Learning Path
    details: 6 prototypes from character movement to complete adventure game. Each builds on the last. Master 2D, then move to 3D.

    title: Learning Together
    details: Parent facilitation guide included. Not "dad teaches son" - it's "we learn together". Celebrate bugs as puzzles to solve.

    title: Path to Dreams
    details: Start simple (top-down 2D) but keep the dream alive (3D like Fortnite). Progressive learning path shows how to get there.

## Our Journey

### Current Status: Setup Complete! 🎉

We've built the foundation. Now it's time to code!

**Next Steps:**
1. Fill out [Game Vision](/specs/GAME_VISION) together
2. Read [Prototype 01 Spec](/prototypes/01-hello-world/spec)
3. Start coding your first game!

### Prototypes Planned

| Prototype | Status | What You'll Learn |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| [01 - Hello World](/prototypes/01-hello-world/spec) | 📝 Ready to Code | Character movement, coordinates, game loop |
| 02 - Obstacles | 📋 Planned | Collision detection, physics |
| 03 - World Exploration | 📋 Planned | Tilemaps, camera following |
| 04 - Collectibles | 📋 Planned | State management, UI |
| 05 - Simple Enemy | 📋 Planned | Game states, AI basics |
| 06 - Player Abilities | 📋 Planned | Abilities, animations, timers |

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Phaser 3 (web game framework)
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Dev Server**: Vite (instant hot reload)
- **Editor**: VS Code
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

**Why JavaScript?** Even though Dad knows Python, we chose JavaScript + Phaser for:
- Instant hot reload (<1 second vs 3-10 seconds)
- Built specifically for games
- Perfect for top-down adventures
- Can evolve to 3D later

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Run prototype 01
npm run dev:01

# Run documentation site locally
npm run docs:dev

# Build documentation for deployment
npm run docs:build
```
